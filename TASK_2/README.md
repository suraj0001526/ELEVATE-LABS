## ¬†Final Thoughts

This email is **very likely a scam**. It tries to look like it's from Wipro and Jain University, but it uses a fake email address and a free Google Form link to collect information. The setup is unprofessional and fails technical security checks.

### What You Should Do:

- **Don‚Äôt click** any links or fill out the form
- **Report** the email to your university or IT team
- Forward it to **[reportphishing@apwg.org](mailto\:reportphishing@apwg.org)**
- **Mark it as phishing** in your email account

## ¬†What You Learn From This

- Always check who sent the email ‚Äî not just the name, but the full email address.
- Don‚Äôt trust emails that ask for personal info through Google Forms.
- Be careful with messages that sound urgent or too good to be true.
- If it mentions a big name (like Wipro), check their official website to confirm.
